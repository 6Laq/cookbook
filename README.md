# Cookbook (project 1)
> a **Javascript** only project. Gives you cool recipes given a set of ingredients

# Instructions to create app
Cookbook is really just a `function`. This function can take an array of recipes like:
```
['peanut butter', 'bread', 'jelly']
```
and return any recipes if found like this:
```
[
  'pbj sandwhich'
]
```

We'll write test too

For extra credit you can expose functions to add recipes and ingredients to Cookbook to make it smarter. This should be able to be executed anywhere Javascript can run.
